## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an advanced Google Analytics 4 (GA4) implementation
to track user behavior and conversion performance on a website registration flow.

## Objective

drop-off points using event-based tracking and funnel analysis.

## Tools Used

## Tracking Setup

3. Form Conversion (Registration Submission)

## Key Insights
